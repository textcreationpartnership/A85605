#####Body#####

1. THE MYSTERY OF God opened.

    _ CHAP. I. The Ʋnion and Oneneſſe of thoſe five grand enemies of the Church, Daniels foure Beasts and little Horne, ſet forth by one Image and one Beaſt.

    _ CHAP. II. This Chapter treats of theſe two witneſſes, or opens thoſe ſeverall titles which the Spirit of God is pleaſed to ſet forth his people by in the time of their exile, ſuitable to the ſtate and condition wherein they were at the ſame time.

    _ CHAP. III This Chapter ſhewes the time of thoſe five Monarchs raigning and tyrannizing it over the Church, (eſpecially of the little borne Antichriſt) when he began and when he ended his raigne, at the ſame time the witneſſes began to prophecy and ended.

    _ CHAP. IV. The tyranny and cruelty of Antichriſt againſt the people of God all his time he was to continue, and the Saints to propheſie; and likewiſe when they had ended their teſtimony with the worke and imployment of the Saints and witneſſes while they were in ſackcloth.

    _ CHAP. V. The witneſſes are ſlaine by Autichriſt, and lye dead three daies and a halfe, are raiſed upon their feet, and aſcend up to Heaven.

    _ CHAP. VI. Chriſt is ſaid to come at this time in the clouds of Heaven, or in his Saints, to execute juddgement upon Antichriſt, with thoſe ſignes of his comming; very few of his Saints that have faith to beleeve this, only ſome few, who are counted wiſe.

    _ CHAP. VII. The ſeventh Chapter openeth the ſeven Seales, Trumpets, and Ʋials; ſhewing that they are all about one and the ſame thing.

    _ CHAP. VIII. The firſt worke of the witneſſes after they are in Heaven, is chiefly the pouring forth of the fifth Ʋiall, and the meanes whereby they doe it, with thoſe effects which follow upon it.

    _ CHAP. IX. The ſixt Viall poured upon Antichriſt, with the way or meanes by which it is done, and the Instrument by whom it is poured forth, the Beaſt and the falſe prophet taken and caſt into a Lake of fire, with the ſilence in Heaven about the ſpace of halfe an houre.

    _ CHAP. X. The ſeventh Viall poured forth; two great effects follow thereupon: The firſt is the hringing in the fullneſſe of the Gentiles. And the ſecond is the calling of the Jewes, with the time when the fifth, ſixth, and ſeventh Viall began and ended, and liberty given to the Saints by the Witneſſes, to build that new Jeruſalem.

    _ CHAP. XI. The two Governments of Chriſt, the one over the Nations, and another over his new Jeruſalem; Chriſt reignes 1000. yeares; Satan and wicked men bound all that ſame time, afterwards looſed and utterly destroyed; The Saints reigning three Termes.
